# "Magic: the Gathering" set icons downloader

This simple script uses the Scryfall's API to get the icon's SVGs, then convert them to PNGs thanks to cairosvg and put them all nicely in an `/out` directory

The script only get the expansions set symbols. If you want a way to download other types of set symbols (such as core sets or commander sets), [just hit me up!](mailto:chez.tibo84@gmail.com) 
(You can find more infos about the different types of sets [here](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/sets))
